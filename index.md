### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because the program included a blackjack calculator. It would accurately calculate the values of a blackjack hand, including restrictions based on previous hand score. It was really interesting to see how this card game's calculations worked.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because the program seemed like something practical that could really be utilized. I was able to write functions that determine whether parking is allowed at a specific time or on a particular day, depending on the street the user is on.

* Lab 10
    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because the program included larger lists of data along with a practical application. I had my program read from a large file that includes information on California counties, allowing me to display the data nicely or extract specific elements, such as county population.
